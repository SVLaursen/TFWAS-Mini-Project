# TFWAS Mini Project
Mini project for the Technologies for Web and Social Media during the 6th Semester of the Medialogy Bachelor at AAU.
This project was made in collaboration with @MyzLi.

The project required every group to choose atleast 3 technologies from a list that the teacher had produced for the class. From said list we decided to work with the MERN stack, as Express, NodeJS and MongoDB was a part of the requirement list. 

## How to run the project
1. Open the project in your code editor of choice and open a terminal window (or use an external CLI)
2. Navigate to the backed through the terminal and run the following command: 
```
node index.js
```
3. Open another terminal window and navigate to the frontend folder, run the command:
```
npm start
```
4. Open your browser and enter in http://localhost:3000 for the front site and http://localhost:3600 for the backend server
5. Remember to visit the admin page on the frontend by entering the address http://localhost:3000/admin

## What I made for the project
For this project I worked primarily on the backend elements, however I did do the frontend work on the admin section of the app and the routing, while @MyzLi focused on the public part of the frontend.

## What I learned
* Setting up a REST API from scratch using Express, Mongoose and NodeJS
* Creating a frontend application using the React framework
* Routing for both frontend and backend
* Doing CRUD operations

## Things to improve 
* Currently some, if not all, components contain redundant code that could be abstracted and make the code more modular.
* Add prop inputs for the elements for easier use
* Create an app wide CSS rule file to remove redundant CSS
